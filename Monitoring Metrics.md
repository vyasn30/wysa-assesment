# Metrics for Sentiment and Product Detection Model

## Sentiment Detection:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of sentiment predictions.
- **Precision and Recall:** Useful for understanding how well the model performs in correctly identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall, providing a comprehensive evaluation.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Gives a detailed breakdown of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

## Product Detection:

- **Accuracy:** Ensures the correctness of product predictions across different categories.
- **Precision and Recall:** Evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify specific products.
- **F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall, providing an overall measure of model performance.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Offers insights into the distribution of correct and incorrect product predictions.

## Latency and Throughput:

- **Inference Latency:** Important for real-time applications to measure how quickly the model provides predictions for a given tweet.
- **Throughput:** The number of inference requests the model can handle, ensuring scalability.

## Data Drift Metrics:

- **Input Data Distribution:** Monitors whether the distribution of tweets remains consistent over time.

## Security Metrics:

- **Model Explainability:** Assess the interpretability of the model's sentiment and product predictions.
- **Model Access Logs:** Monitor and audit access to the deployed sentiment and product detection model for security purposes.

## Monitoring Infrastructure Metrics:

- **System Uptime:** Ensures the availability and reliability of the deployed model for continuous predictions.
- **Error Rates:** Tracks the rate of errors or failures in the system.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Adversarial Attacks:** Evaluate the model's robustness to adversarial attempts to manipulate sentiment or product predictions.
- **Out-of-Distribution Detection:** Assess the model's ability to recognize tweets discussing products not encountered during training.
